# node.js-meme-generator

This is a meme generator that is written on node.js using some dependencies.

This program would extract all the urls from the given webpage and extract all
the images from the urls and save them in a folder inside the program called
memes. Any url can be manually passed to the program as it is hardcoded.

## Getting Started

```bash
node index.js

When the program runs then the images should be on the designated folder.

First, make sure that your system has node.js installed: If not just install it
